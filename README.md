Model Tuning:

1) Loan Delinquency Analysis (Loan_Delinquent_Analysis): <br>
A certain bank is interested in predicting the delinquency risk of its customers before loan approval. In order to do so,
a sample dataset of 10,000+ clients, containing their attributes such as gender, age, FICO score and home ownership status,
have been provided for ML-based modeling. Logistic regression has been adopted as the classification method. The further
boosting of the baseline model has been attempted using upsampling (oversampling), downsapling (undersampling) and 
regularization. <br>
Key tools: Logistic Regression, K-Fold Cross-Validation, Over/Undersampling, Regularization <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, imblearn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas
